/*
Given an ordered set of tiles, how many different permutations are there? 
And more importantly, how many adjacent tile swaps did it take to make that permutation?
Example: 
  0 swaps: abc
  1 swap: bac, acb
  2 swaps: bca, cab
  3 swaps: cba   
  Summary: (permutation, # of swaps); (abc, 0), (bac, 1), (acb, 1), (bca, 2), (cab,2), (cba,3)
