# Re-doing balanced parens problem from Interview Cake
  # Adding Jasmine tests for BDD

# Used phantomjs instead of Chrome
  # but errors were not showing corresponding line numbers (ie stack traces)

# See stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19422393/karma-jasmine-show-line-number-when-test-failed
  # And this fix: https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/pull/291
  # I modified /usr/local/lib/node_modules/karma-jasmine/lib/jasmine.js to make Jasmine throw an error for failed expectations

# Side note: /user/local/bin contains scripts to run bower, npm, karma, gulp etc. from the command line!
